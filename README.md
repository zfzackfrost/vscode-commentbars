# Comment Bars

## What's a Comment Bar anyway?

**Comment Bars**, in the context of this extension, are comments in your
code that help to separate your work into logical sections. Here are some 
Comment Bars using C-style comments:

Plain separator, no text:
```c
/* ====================================================== */
/* ====================================================== */
/* ====================================================== */
```

Same as above, with added text:
```c
/* ====================================================== */
/* ================== Comment Bars Rock ================= */
/* ====================================================== */
```

Want to customize width, dash (fill) character or thickness? No problem!
```c
/* -------- Thinner ------- */
```

The Comment Bars extension automatically generates these separators.

### Seamless Filling

When seamless filling is enabled, the Comment Bars extension will attempt to
remove spaces between the comment delimeters and the fill characters. This ONLY
happens if the bordering character of the delimeters is the same character as
the fill character. Take a look at some examples.

The following examples were generated by the plugin, with a Python 
source code file active. Python uses the `#` symbol to start single
line comments. As a result, these examples are applicaple to any 
syntax with a similar comment format. Lets get to it!

Python comment bar without seamless filling:
```python
# ######################################################## #
# ##################### Not Seamless ##################### #
# ######################################################## #
```
Notice the spaces after the starting `#` symbol and before the
ending `#` symbol, on each line.

Lets try that again, this time with seamless filling:
```python
############################################################
######################### Seamless #########################
############################################################
```
Now those spaces are gone! Magic!

Lets change the fill character from the last example (still with seamless
filling turned on):

```python
# ======================================================== #
# ======================= Seamless? ====================== #
# ======================================================== #
```
Notice that the spaces between the comment delimeters 
and the fill characters come back now. This is the intended operation
of seamless filling. 

#### Activating Seamless Filling
At the moment, seamless filling is only available by using quick presets.

## Terminology

In order to use this extension there are a few terms that you should 
be aware of. 

- *fill character* &mdash; A single character of text that 
   is repeated across the entire width of the comment bar.
   
- *comment delimter* &mdash; The string of code that a programming
   language looks for to indicate the beginning or end of a comment.

## Commands and Instructions

- `commentbars.generateAdvanced` &mdash; labeled "Comment Bars:
   Generate (Advanced)"  in Command Palette. Generate a comment 
   bar using *Advanced* mode. 
  
  **Command Instructions:**
   1. If you wish for your comment bar to contain text, type the text
      on an empty line and select it. Otherwise move the cursor to 
	  the empty line where you wish to insert the comment bar.
   2. Open the Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and Linux, 
      `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac
   3. Find and run the command called *Comment Bars: Generate (Advanced)*
   4. Enter the the requested information in the boxes that pop up at
      the top of the editor.

- `commentbars.generateQuick` &mdash; labeled "Comment Bars:
   Generate (Quick)" in Command Palette. Generate a comment bar
   using a preset style (*Quick* mode).

   **Command Instructions:**
   1. If you wish for your comment bar to contain text, type the text
      on an empty line and select it. Otherwise move the cursor to 
	  the empty line where you wish to insert the comment bar.
   2. Open the Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and Linux, 
      `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac
   3. Find and run the command called *Comment Bars: Generate (Quick)*
   4. Select the appropriate comment bar preset style from the list.
      > **Tip** <br/>
	  > The presets can be customized with the `commentbars.quickPresets`
	  > setting.

## Settings

This extension is highly configurable. The following lists the 
available settings for customizing the plugin:

- `commentbars.defaultFillChar` 
  (see [Terminology](#terminology))
  &mdash; The default *fill character*. At the moment this is currently
   only used by the *Advanced* mode since `quickPresets` requires a fill
   character to be specified. Must be a string with a length of 1.

- `commentbars.quickPresets` &mdash; The available preset styles for *Quick* mode.
   Must be an array of objects. Each object accepts the following keys:
    - `label` &mdash; The name of the preset to display in the selection menu

	- `fillChar` &mdash; The fill character to use when this preset style 
	   is selected

	- `width` &mdash; The width of comment bars created using this preset style
	
	- `thickness` &mdash; The number of lines tall the comment bar will be, when 
	   using this preset style. This value will be rounded up to the nearest odd
	   number in order to keep the text centered vertically.
	
	- `seamlessFill` (see [Seamless Filling](#seamless-filling)) &mdash; 
	   *Optional*, Enable seamless filling? Must be a `bool` (Default: `false`)

- `commentbars.commentDelimsUser` 
   (see [Delimeter Configuration](#comment-delimeters-configuration)) 
   &mdash; The set of comment delimeters that is meant to be
   overridden by the user. The default value is empty. 

- `commentbars.commentDelimsFallback`
  (see [Delimeter Configuration](#comment-delimeters-configuration)) 
  &mdash; The default set of comment delimeters. This should
  usually be left at the default. The intended use of this setting is to only override
  the default if there is an error in the default settings (As much as I would like to,
  I don't know every programming lanuguage VSCode supports!). **For customizations and 
  additions, use `commentDelimsUser` instead**.
 
### Comment Delimeters Configuration
The default comment delimeters for most languages in Comment
bars use single line comments. In these cases, the start delimeter 
is repeated as the end delimeter for symmetry.
